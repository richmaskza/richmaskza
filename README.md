- 👋 Hi, I’m @richmaskza
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and developing an NFT Marketplace with its own blockchain to support and promote upcoming music artist and their art by providing a decentralised platform that will enable them to: create music NFTS,protect, sell, buy trade music and transact peer to peer with zero transaction fees while learning crypo. Artist will be able to protect their music using the blockchain and convert their influence / followers into crypto. Fans will be able to directly support their favorite artist, discover and support upcoming artists
