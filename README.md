ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @richmaskza, the founder of web3Transition, a blockchain technology company that offers innovative solutions for loyalty programs and digital marketplaces. Our goal is to revolutionize these industries by providing efficient, secure, and cost-effective solutions for businesses and consumers.

Our product offerings include:

Loyalty 3.0: A blockchain-based rewards system that allows businesses to create customised merchant crypto coins/tokens for their loyalty programs. These tokens can be deposited directly into a compatible crypto wallet and used as payment for goods or services at a rate of 1:1 with the local currency. Loyalty 3.0 provides standardisation, security, transparency, simplicity, flexibility, and convenience for both businesses and customers while reducing carbon footprints.

ArtsolMusic NFTs: A digital marketplace for music NFTs, allowing users to trade and own music NFTs using crypto coins. Sales are paid out immediately to creator wallets, giving content creators complete control over assets while bypassing the need for a middleman.

Open NFT: A platform for creating and trading NFTs of any kind. Open NFT will allow users to create unique and custom NFTs, with a user-friendly design for buying, selling, and managing these NFTs.

We also offer custom crypto token creation for organizations or individuals.

Currently, I am learning rust, solidity,Ignite Cli, node.js, next.js, IFPS, Ether.js, Solitude, Geth, ERC Smart Contracts, javascript, linux server, and Cosmo SDK to enhance my skills and knowledge.

I am looking to collaborate on developing web3transition with other developers and partners who share the same passion and vision.

You can reach me at richmask@gmail.com to discuss any potential collaborations or ideas.
